### Postmortem: Server Failure



#### Issue Summary

- **Duration:** The server decided to take an unscheduled nap from 8:00 PM to 10:30 PM (UTC+0).

- **Impact:** Our beloved customer login portal took an extended coffee break, causing intermittent frustration and slow response times for users. Approximately 30% of our users were left twiddling their thumbs.

- **Root Cause:** Turns out, the server's main disk drive had a mid-life crisis and decided it no longer wanted to participate in the digital realm.



#### Timeline

- **8:00 PM:** Our vigilant monitoring system rudely interrupted our evening plans with an alert for high latency and increased error rates.

- **Actions taken:** The operations team sprang into action, investigating every nook and cranny of our networking infrastructure and database servers. We even looked for hidden treasure!

- **Misleading investigation paths:** We chased wild geese down the rabbit hole, spending hours optimizing database queries and untangling network switches. Sadly, no treasure was found.

- Frustrated and slightly defeated, we escalated the incident to the infrastructure and database teams, hoping they could bring some fresh eyes to the situation.

- **9:30 PM:** Eureka! After extensive investigation, we realized that the culprit was not a mischievous network gremlin or a grumpy database, but a faulty disk drive.

- **10:00 PM:** The hardware team swooped in like superheroes and identified the rogue disk drive as the mastermind behind the server's misbehavior.

- **Resolution:** With a swift swap of the disk drive, the server finally woke up from its slumber at 10:30 PM, ready to get back to work.



#### Root Cause and Resolution

The server failure was caused by a rebellious disk drive that decided to retire prematurely. To restore order, we replaced the faulty disk drive, giving the server a new lease on life.



#### Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent future surprises from our mischievous hardware, we have devised a plan:

- **Operation Redundancy:** Implementing redundancy mechanisms for critical server components, because no one likes being left in the lurch.

- **Fortify Monitoring:** Enhancing our monitoring systems to develop a sixth sense for hardware failures and prevent them from sneaking up on us.

- **Escalation Expertise:** Establishing clear incident escalation procedures, ensuring prompt involvement of the right teams to tackle issues head-on.

- **Hardware Health Checks:** Regularly checking our hardware's pulse to catch any signs of trouble before they escalate into a full-blown crisis.

- **Backup Bonanza:** Establishing a comprehensive backup strategy to ensure we never lose precious data, even if our hardware decides to go on an extended vacation.

- **Sharing is Caring:** Documenting this adventure and sharing our lessons learned with the team, so we can all grow and improve together.



In conclusion, our server's mid-life crisis resulted in an unscheduled nap, but we swiftly resolved the issue by replacing the faulty disk drive. By implementing preventive measures and learning from this misadventure, we aim to keep our systems running smoothly and avoid any future disruptions. Stay tuned for more thrilling tales from the world of servers!
